Programs required for the "Effective Programming Practices for Economists" Course
=================================================================================================

This little document is supposed to help you install all programs that are necessary for the course on your own computer. It will gradually evolve with your feedback. **Please** `drop me a line <mailto:hmgaudecker@gmail.com>`_ **if any links are outdated, descriptions are unclear, or you encounter problems.**

If everything goes smoothly and you have a fast machine and a fast Internet connection, you should be done within half an hour. If you run into any problems or need considerably more time than this, don't hesitate to ask me to help you out. I expect this to be a hurdle for some of you at this point, so don't be shy to ask for help.

**Please follow the steps one-by-one in and do not deviate AT ALL from them, unless you really know what you are doing.** Getting off the beaten path has proven to be the #1 source of errors in previous rounds.
