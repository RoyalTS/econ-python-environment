Troubleshooting in Eclipse
============================


PyDev perspective not shown
_____________________________

Eclipse knows about various screen setups depending what you are doing at the moment. When you are writing Python code you want to see different information than when you are debugging it, etc. You can change manually between perspectives at the top right corner, and sometimes the PyDev perspective is not shown automatically, like here:

.. image:: no_pydev_perspective1.png
    :width: 12cm

Click on the icon on the far left and select `Other...`:

.. image:: no_pydev_perspective2.png
    :width: 12cm

Now select PyDev and click OK.
